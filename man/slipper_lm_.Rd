\title{Bootstrap a linear regression model}
\usage{
slipper_lm_(df, formula, null_formula = NULL, B = 100, boot_resid = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame}

\item{formula}{A an expression for a formula to pass to the lm command}

\item{null_formula}{(optional) If NULL, standard bootstrapping is performed. If a nested expression for a null formula is passed the bootstrapped statistics come from the null.}

\item{B}{the number of bootstrap samples to draw}

\item{boot_resid}{If TRUE then bootstrapping residuals is performed.}
}
\value{
out A data frame with the values, whether they come from the observed data or the bootstrapped data, and the coefficient name.
}
\description{
Takes a data frame, and a model to fit to the data
and each bootstrap replicate. Bootstrapping is by
default resampling cases, but if you set boot_resid=TRUE
then resampling residuals will be performed. If you
pass a null model formula that includes a subset
of the variables in the full model (i.e. it is a 
nested model) then the bootstrap statistics will
come from the bootstrapped null data and can be
used for a hypothesis test.
